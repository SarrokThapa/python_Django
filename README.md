# Student Marks Filter Project

A simple Python program that:
- Creates a CSV file with student names and marks
- Filters and creates a second CSV file containing only students who scored **more than 60 marks**

Perfect for learning file handling and CSV operations in Python!

F-strings in Python (introduced in 3.6) are prefixed with 'f' or 'F' and use curly braces {} to embed variables or expressions directly, like f"Hello, {name}! Sum: {x + y}." This makes string formatting readable and fast, outperforming older methods like str.format(). They support inline calculations, formatting (e.g., {pi:.2f} for "3.14"), and debugging ({var!r} for repr), but require 3.6+ and limit braces to expressions only.
